        "- main components that compose DenseNet are dense blocks and transition layers. For the latter, we need to keep the dimensionality under control when composing the network by adding transition layers that shrink the number of channels again. \n",

        "1. Why do we use average pooling rather than max-pooling in the transition layer?\n",
        "1. One of the advantages mentioned in the DenseNet paper is that its model parameters are smaller than those of ResNet. Why is this the case?\n",
        "1. One problem for which DenseNet has been criticized is its high memory consumption.\n",
        "    1. Is this really the case? Try to change the input shape to $224\\times 224$ to see the actual GPU memory consumption empirically.\n",
        "    1. Can you think of an alternative means of reducing the memory consumption? How would you need to change the framework?\n",

        "1. Design an MLP-based model by applying the DenseNet idea. Apply it to the housing price prediction task in :numref:`sec_kaggle_house`."
